1. Github is neat cause it enables easier collaboration and it also provides a convient place for me to store project code.
2. Sometimes (even though it is mostly due to user error) working in a project with a large group is still clunky.
3. What is the social ettiquite for submiting bug fixes and edits to someone else's code in a shared project (so as not to be disrespectful).
   1. Do not be a jerk. 
   2. Publicly listing an issue / pull request / feature request is way better than emailing/contacting separately the author to do this and that and that you have found a major flaw / issue, feature request. People usually maintain their project through GH already, so do not cross the system.
   3. Describe your commit / issue conscise and complete. If you are submitting an issue, describe your operating system, ways to reproduce etc. More info here: https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/
   4. If your change is rejected for some reason, respect the reason. 
   5. IF your motivation is to contribute to the project and make it better, go ahead and fear not. 
   6. Do not be a jerk (I think it is so important I have listed it twice)*
