What I like about Github is the purple cat icon is so cute. I am new on Git so I need to explore more before I can say more things that I like.
  - that is cute :D

The thing that I dislike about Github is the visualization is not that much for me. And sometimes I get confused and doubt that if the things I changed are actually changed.

The question I have about Git is can I request a pull for several files I changed together or I need to do it one by one?
  - the pull request is actually a merge of your whole branch. So whatever you do in YOUR fork (your copy of my repository), be it one or dozen new files, edits and deletes, is contained in your pull request.
