Git could track each version of documents without losing important changes. What’s more, it makes people all over the world be accessible to the codes and have opportunity to edit codes. 

Since I was new to Git and still learn how to play with it, sometimes it seems a little bit abstract to me.

Question: sometimes it shows ”conflict” and couldn’t merge. What kind of things are conflicted to each other?
  - *Conflict my happen during merging branches, when it can't be resolved automatically, that is when the same line has been edited on both branches and Git can't decide what should be kept. Otherwise all simple additions and deletes are applied (merged automatically). When files are conflicted, we have to resolve the conflicts before copmleting the merge. So, you could merge conflicts, you just have to oversee the operation and help the Git a bit.*
