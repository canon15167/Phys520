1.like about GitHub

It does help me easily mange all the changes to my text files.

2.dislike about GitHub

It seems that GitHub only works to text file, so I cannot use it on doing group presentations of other courses.

Sometimes branches become confusing.


3.At least one question

Sometimes when I tried to merge into current branch, It shows "this branch is up to date with (branch name)", while in history it seems that two branches have different content.

How did you visualize Branching in Github?

How is the security of Github? Can I manage sensitive data with it?
