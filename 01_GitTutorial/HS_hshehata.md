I like that GitHub is easy to use and share
I dislike that GitHub is mainley public
  - you can go store your repository whenever you want to, yet this is a GitHubs business model - free for public, pay for commerce (that is shared private). Note, that you can have as many private repos as you want to, but the sharing and collaborative options are limited.

Question: for an average programmer, how much GitHub expeirnce do I need?
  - *The more the better :) Start using it on regular basis. Committing everyday, rolling back every week, being able to get a previous version, branching or merging once a month and doing some serious complicated operation once a year would take imho five years to get you fully professional. Concentrate on doing your job and use git just as you use an elevator - you usually just need to go to your fifth floor and back, thats about it. But if you are moving furniture, it comes really handy and I am pretty confident you will find a way when the need arises.*.
