1) I like github because it helps with version control for collabrations between contributors. It is also a great place to find useful source code and tutorials. 

2) One thing I do not enjoy about Github is the complexity of naming of functions such as fork, branch, push, pull. 

3) My question is that what is the name for the subject that stores many repos together? 
    For example, in the github for the R package tidyverse, https://github.com/tidyverse, there are many repos belong to this page. Is this page a repo itself?
    - *it is called organization. Organization could have a number of public or private repositories, similar to  what an individual could have. See the difference in beards-lab: It unifies the collective effort under one brand, the commits are done by individuals (the team) though. You could have unlimited team members here so everyone could write access any of organizational repositories (or a subset of), as long as the organization and its repositories are public. For private repositories and organization you have to start paying to GitHub*.
