1. Git allows people working on a project to easily work together and share the same up-to-date files. It also allows a lot of important work to be open for anyone to look at.

2. I am still getting used to the interface of Git and there are a lot of ways to handle Git (command line, website, GitHub Desktop) which makes it confusing for me.

3. Can I write into files within a repository from the command line?
   - *Something like https://superuser.com/questions/186857/how-do-i-edit-text-files-in-the-windows-command-prompt ? The repository is basically your local folder. Or you meant accessing the history, commiting, pushing, and all that stuff? The Git has been designed for command line, but I am no expert on the commands. The https://git-scm.com/docs/ should have your back.  But unless you are a big nerd {no offence), you are just fine to stick to any GUI tool you like (the GitHub desktop is possibly the simplest and most user-friendly one). You can of course edit your files directly in the github.com, but this is really impractical (that is, do not do it!) for your source codes.*
